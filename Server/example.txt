After reading the README file, try to request this file to the server by using the client application.

Start the server:
	Go to the server folder using a terminal and type: 
		"python3 server.py [port number]"
	without the quotes.
The server will print its IP address.

Start the client:
	Using a different terminal, go to the client's folder and type:
		"python3 client.py [IP printed by server] [portNumber] "example.txt""

You should now be able to see a copy of this file in your client's folder and details of the file transaction on both terminals.
